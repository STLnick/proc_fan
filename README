OS Project 1
Process fan (proc_fan)

GitHub repo: https://github.com/STLnick/proc_fan

To run the program:
First run 'make' to build 'proc_fan' and 'testsim'

To execute with the sample data file run:

./proc_fan -n 3 < inputs.data

Where '3' is the limit of processes to run concurrently and 'inputs.data' is the file input to redirect to 'proc_fan'.


What Works:
The program 'proc_fan' successfully forks and execs different processes allowing only the specified amount from
the command line argument to run concurrently. 'perror' is used in multiple places to output meaningful error messages
for the user upon an error.


What Doesn't Work:
Running commands other than 'testsim'.
